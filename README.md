# CNN-Cat-and-Dog

The objective of this project was to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying dog and cat images. A large dataset of images of dogs and cats was collected, and the images were preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them to improve the model's accuracy and generalization.

A suitable deep learning architecture for the image classification task was chosen, such as a CNN. The CNN model was trained on the preprocessed dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimization techniques. Once the model was trained and validated, it was deployed in real-world scenarios, such as a mobile app or a web service, for image classification tasks

In this project, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for Dog and Cat image classification. The model was trained on a large dataset of images and achieved an accuracy of 72% on the test set. Project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNN models for image classification tasks, and highlights the importance of careful model selection and hyperparameter tuning. With further refinement, this model could have valuable applications in areas such as animal welfare, veterinary medicine, and biometric security.
